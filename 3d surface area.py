#Madison is a little girl who is fond of toys. Her friend Mason works in a toy manufacturing factory . Mason has a 2D board  of size  with  rows and  columns. The board is divided into cells of size  with each cell indicated by its coordinate . The cell  has an integer  written on it. To create the toy Mason stacks  number of cubes of size  on the cell .

#Given the description of the board showing the values of  and that the price of the toy is equal to the 3d surface area find the price of the toy.
